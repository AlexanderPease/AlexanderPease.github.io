Iâ€™m an entrepreneur, product lead, and angel investor living in New York City. Right now, I'm figuring out my next project.

<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
Most recently I led Platform at [Hyperscience](hyperscience.com), a Series E company applying AI to enterprise automation. This included running 1/2 our Product Management team as well as stepping in as interim VP of Product Design.

Prior to that, I co-founded [Nomad Health](nomadhealth.com), a marketplace for temporary clinical staffing, and led the Product team through our Series B, by which time we had worked with a few hundred hospitals and had raised $20M in VC funding. Nomad continues to do quite well. During my time at Nomad I was also a partner at First Round Capital's Product Co-Op, a small scout fund that made pre-seed investments in [Parade](yourparade.com), [Universe](onuniverse.com), [Light](thelightphone.com), and a few other cool companies.

I started my career on the [Union Square Ventures](usv.com) investment team, leading research in blockchain and digital healthcare spaces. 

Right now, I'm figuring out my next project. Part of the journey is writing (for the first time in a long time) and angel investing (for the first time).

As a lifelong classical pianist, I grew up studying classical at Tanglewood and the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. I have (briefly) performed at Carnegie Hall. For the past few years I've been studying jazz improvisation. I was a (mediocre) D1 athlete, having walked onto the Princeton track team as a long jumper; now I play soccer and boulder for fun.
